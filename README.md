# Student Management System developed in Laravel

This simple project is developed for the most part using Laravel version 9 alone, except for the very basic styling used using Bootstrap.

## How to use

- Clone the repository with __git clone__
- Copy __.env.example__ file to __.env__ and edit database credentials there
- Run __composer install__
- Run __php artisan key:generate__
- Run __php artisan migrate__ 
- That's it: launch the main URL. The master records for teacher and then students have to created first.
